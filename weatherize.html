            </p>
            <p>
              While designing the app, I applied the principles of the User Centred Design Process.
            </p>
            <p>
              My objective was to design an app that would be <b>simple, easy and give users a fast access to the weather data</b> they want to see. I also wanted it to be <b>different that most of the existing weather apps</b> in terms of its "look
              & feel".

            <p>
              The first step was to take a look at two water sports specialised weather services: Surfline and WindyApp. This only showed that, although the weather data is very comprehensive, it is presented in a rather complex, unclear and
              difficult to
              understand way. Moreover, the "look & feel" and the way the data is displayed is very similar in most of the weather apps (not only the ones I have taken a closer look at).

            <h3>The User Research Plot</h3>
            <p>
              I started the process of understanding my target group with conducting an on-line survey to gather some initial information about the users, their needs and behaviours regarding both - the water sports and the weather apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              My intention was to use the learnings from the survey to polish the user interview questionnaire, for the interviews which I was planning to run afterwards.

                  <li>explore the specific insights/findings from the survey and generate new insights to be used during the next stages of the design process.</li>

                <p>
                  I performed the analysis of the interviews using the affinity mapping technique and came up with the insights allowing me to take actionable steps and create the solutions fulfilling users’ needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>
                    The research showed that all that the users want and need is a simple and not overcomplicated app with a fast access to the most important data, which will be presented in a clear and easy to understand way, so that they will be
                    able to use it "with one finger" even in unfavourable conditions (e.g. on a rocking boat during a heavy rain).
                  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The users also confirmed that most of the apps are looking the same and complicated way, therefore it would be nice to have an <b>app which is different that the others and presents the data in a more user-friendly way.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Further, the research confirmed that my potentia users are a group of <b>very active people, who love to practice their water sports</b> and cannot wait the moment they are out there on the water again, very often regardless of the
                  weather conditions.</p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, I have also identified some <b>features that could be considered on the later stages</b>, after the MVP is completed. These could potentially be: live web cams for the locations, possibility of taking a
                  picture with the current weather data and the location displayed or some social features (e.g. chat).

                <p>
                  I have shared my work with three fellow students and asked them to comment on my design. Overall, the feedback was very consistent. The app has been evaluated as <b>very simple, clear and effective</b>. None of the colleagues had
                  any problems with completing the tasks. I have received only very minor comments:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>revision of the social media logos (for the social sign up),</li>
                  <li>finding a better way of showing the error message when typing an incorrect email address or too weak password,</li>
                  <li>finding a better way to display the password requirements, as they were not visible enough,</li>
                  <li>removing unnecessary "X" from the search bar (before the user types in anything),</li>
                  <li>increasing the spaces between the search autocomplete results in order to make them easier to select.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Two of the tests have shown a statistically significant preference for one of the tested options, which I have included in the final version later on. The third one went through another cycle of iterations before getting the
                  final
                  look.

                <p>
                  When applying the visual styling to my wireframes, except the fact that the app needs to be clear and the data easy to read, I had in my mind the two following principles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the target users are an active & dynamic, "adrenaline driven" group,</li>
                  <li>I want to differentiate the app visually from the other weather apps.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Therefore, <b>I decided to give it a sporty "look& feel"</b> (which is used for e.g. sport/sport tracking apps), which not only fulfilled the requirements of being clear and dynamic, bit also allowed to escape from the "sun-blue
                  sky-rain drops" weather apps cliche.
